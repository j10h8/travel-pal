# TravelPal

**Overview**

TravelPal is a showcase/portfolio demo project, and is intended to be used for demonstration purposes only. The application is built as a WPF/XAML application, utilizing C# for coding the logic and behavior. Data is stored in lists, and not in a database, why the application does not provide any persistence over sessions. The application demonstrates comprehensive CRUD operations. User accounts can be created, travels can be added (including packing list), updated, and removed. User account details can be updated. Admin user account has the ability to remove other user accounts.

**Local Deployment Instructions**

To run the application locally, simply run it from Visual Studio. Upon start, the application will automatically create one admin account (user name: "admin", password: "password") and one sample user account (user name: "user", password: "password").
